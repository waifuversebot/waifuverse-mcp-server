# rules
- plan work first
- do work
  - verify between steps
- verify against plan
- use meaningful logging so we can debug (quality over quantity)
- whenever possible try to reuse existing code and logic
- DO NOT BURY EXCEPTIONS
- avoid over-engineering
- avoid introducing new variables when existing ones will work fine
- point out any problems you see w older code but do not correct unless related to task
- when calling functions, carefully check order of parameters and data types

# architecture overview
- this is a simple mcp (model context protocol) npx client and two server implementations: python and node
- has the ability to add and remove things (namely dynamic functions and mcp servers) on the fly
- ignore node-server folder for now, that is an mcp client
- the python mcp sdk is located at /Users/reinman/work/mcp/python-sdk
- the typescript node mcp sdk is located at /Users/reinman/work/mcp/typescript-sdk
- server.py is the main python server that runs everything
- NEVER TOUCH THE CLOUD MESSAGE PROTOCOL WITHOUT EXPLICIT APPROVAL BECAUSE IT CAN BREAK THE CLOUD SERVER

# dynamic functions
- dynamic functions are stored in the dynamic_functions folder
- see DynamicFunctionManager.py
- dynamic functions can still be stored and retrieved even if invalid
- dynamic functions invoked by tools/call
- function_set must allow invalid Python

# dynamic (mcp) servers
- adds the ability to host other mcp tools as if they are part of our own
- these are simple JSON
- see DynamicServerManager.py
- server_set must allow invalid JSON
- server_get_tools will get a list of mcp tools from a started mcp server (openweather and openweather.json is a good example)
